# Credmark Models and Model Framework

Credmark has created a Model Framework for creators to allow them easy access to Credmark's inhouse integrated, curated, and historical blockchain data via standard data models and to enable creators to leverage these models to build their own models and publish them.

It contains dependencies to the [Credmark Model Framework repo](https://github.com/credmark/credmark-model-framework-py) as well as the credmark-dev command-line tool, that lets you list the models in the local repo and run local models as you develop. It will also run remote non-local models on the server by automatically doing API calls when models are not present locally. Once the Credmark model framework is installed you can use this command-line tool.
